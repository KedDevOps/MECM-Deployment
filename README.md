# MECM-Deployment
This project demonstrates the deployment of Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM) in a cloud-based lab environment using three Windows Server virtual machines (VMs) hosted in Microsoft Azure. The setup includes:

A Domain Controller (DC01) for Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP services

A SQL Server (SQL01) to host the MECM site database

A Primary Site Server (MECM01) to run Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager

The goal of this project is to simulate an enterprise-level MECM deployment for testing, demonstration, or training purposes, including configuration of client discovery, software updates, and application deployment.
